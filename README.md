# Ethiopian-wheat-forecasting-by-SARIMAX-model
This project applies time series forecasting to model and predict Ethiopiaâ€™s wheat production using FAOSTAT data. The study explores the relationship between area harvested (predictor) and production quantity (target) through SARIMAX models.  
# ðŸ“Š Data Source

FAOSTAT (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)

Variables used:

Area harvested (ha)

Yield (kg/ha)

Production quantity (tons)

#  Methodology

Data Collection & Cleaning (FAOSTAT wheat dataset for Ethiopia).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

# Trend visualization

 # Correlation analysis (Area vs. Yield, r â‰ˆ 0.87).

# Modeling:

SARIMAX: Production ~ Area harvested

Baseline ARIMA for comparison

 # Evaluation:

# Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

Normalized RMSE (% of mean production).

 # Forecasting:

Predicting future production with projected area harvested.

# Results

Mean Production: ~5.5 million tons

SARIMAX RMSE: ~299,455 tons

Error as % of Mean: ~5.4% â†’ Good predictive accuracy

# Key Insight

Ethiopiaâ€™s wheat production shows a strong upward trend, largely explained by increases in area harvested.
SARIMAX provides reliable forecasts for future production, helping inform land use, input allocation, and food security policies.
